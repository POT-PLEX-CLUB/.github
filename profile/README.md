## Who are we?
This network is a Minecraft Bedrock Practice network and is a non-profit organization. We intend to make no money from this server or the community. We simply intend to make something enjoyable!
We intend to offer an FFA game-mode-based server with NoDebuff as its main focus, however, we will include other modes to keep things interesting. 

## Why is this a thing?
To be clear this organization was made to help share work and progress of the server between developers and administrators so don't expect to see much here as a regular visitor passing through, however, this doesn't mean you're at a loss, while we do intend to keep our source code for our core private you can still check out our repository's to see if we added anything for the public.

## Oh your not a regular passing through?
Get in touch with David over @ discord.gg/potplex he has no problem getting you set up here!
